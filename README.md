# EcommerceAPP

## GOAL
With the OOP logic, the e-commerce application was targeted and it was aimed to list the products and to keep the products in the basket with the session.

There is no database connection in the project; alternatively, the json file method is used. The desired products on the page are kept in this json file with their properties and the user will be able to add and remove them to the basket. The total price information of the products in this basket will also be calculated and displayed to the user.

##### The project has not been completed yet, it continues.
